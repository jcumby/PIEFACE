Changes to be implemented
=========================

- Add more tutorials and examples.
- Add polyhedron search based on coordinate rather than specific atom

Bugfixes
========

- Catch more errors, and provide useful user feedback.
- Check what happens if mutliple ligands with the same label exist (check CIF specification)
- Centre search seems to be case-dependent; need to check
- Permission denied error on writing pickle with GUI (AMAL)
- If ellipsoid process does not produce a 'phases' output, file cannot be removed within GUI.
	* Specific example is if using an incorrect 'advanced' string - process halts, GUI stays active, but file cannot be removed.
